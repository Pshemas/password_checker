# Password checker - 3rd project for Pycamp #
My solution for the 3rd project that Pycamp bootcamp creators have come up with.

[Pycamp.pl](https://www.pycamp.pl)

This is refactored version - after watching the "official" solution I've learned quite a bit about structuring the code, so even though my inital one worked, I've redone the whole thing.  
The new structure made testing a whole lot easier and it was much more fun to build it this way.  

It was also a good opportunity to try out Poetry for handling dependencies, venvs and packaging.  
So all in all - yet another super enjoyable project, that allowed me to learn a lot.
